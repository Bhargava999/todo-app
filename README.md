- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I Learned

During the development of this Tip Calculator app, I gained valuable insights and skills:

- **React State Management:** Utilized the `useState` hook to manage and update state variables for bill amount, number of people, selected tip percentage, and custom tip input.

- **Conditional Rendering:** Implemented conditional rendering to display error messages and prevent calculations when input values are not valid.

- **Responsive Design:** Employed mobile-first design principles and utilized Flexbox and CSS Grid to create a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes.

- **Form Handling:** Managed form inputs for bill amount, number of people, and custom tip using controlled components, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **React Component Structure:** Organized the code into functional components, promoting reusability and maintainability.

- **Styled Components:** Leveraged the Styled Components library for styling, enabling a more modular and maintainable CSS approach.

These learnings have enhanced my proficiency in React development, state management, and responsive design, contributing to my overall growth as a front-end developer.
